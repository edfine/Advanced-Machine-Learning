# Advanced-Machine-Learning

Hi guys. Let's use this repo as a place to keep the course.  
Even though this is contributed to Master, please use branches for your code.  
You should not be creating most of this from scratch.  This is mostly an editing and curating job.  
Harvest from example notebooks that I have shown where possible.  Also blog posts or other repos with tutorials.  
Let's get a "shitty first draft" up in the next two days.  It is OK if it has big parts that say TODO.  I want to get to a 
minimum viable course and then revise.  
Thanks!
