# Day 2 - Neural Networks

## A brief overview of deep neural networks

+ Neural Networks
	* Inputs, activation (sigmoid, ReLU), output(s).
	* Feedforward. Prediction error, cost function.
	* Training: Optimization, gradient descent. Backpropagation.


+ Deep NNs - the origins:
	* Images, audio, words: Levels of representation. Manual feature engineering.
	* Learning hierarchies of representations from data: Deep Learning.
	* Breakthroughs achieved by Deep Learning models in toughest ML/AI problems.
		* Has been around for long. Success came with increase in computing power (e.g. GPUs), data (e.g. hundreds of thousands, even millions of labeled images), and better training, regularization (e.g. dropout) etc. techniques.
	
## Visual networks with CNNs

+ Intro: Deep Learning for Images: CNNs.

+ Structure of CNNs.
	+ Convolution: a fundamental image (signal) operation.
	+ Convolution layers (vs. dense layers that we saw before).
	+ Other layer types typical in CNNs: pooling, ...
	
+ Using sample pre-trained models:
	* Object recognition.
	* Face recognition.
	
+ Transfer learning: fine tune an existing model with new special purpose data.

+ Building and training a CNN from scratch.
